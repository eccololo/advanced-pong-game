# Advanced Pong Game
This is a simple pong game made in **Python** and **Turtle Library** with some cool
features that I could call more advanced. This project is the result of about a year
of learning Python and later **Game Development** in Python using Turtle library.

It is my own project and I am building it **from scratch**. I hope you will find this code 
useful and I hope it will teach you something about Python or Game Dev in this language.
 
## Authors
Hello, my name is **Mateusz Hyla** and I am intermediate at Python programming and beginner at
Game Development in this langauge. I run a **STEM blog** at [mstem.net](www.mstem.net). I post there articles 
about my life as well as Python programming and mathematics.

On my blog you can find all links to my **social media**. Feel free to connect there with me. 

## Experience
At the moment I have only a little experience in **Web Design** field by doing a company website for
one company in Scotland. You can see this website at [Thistle Apartments](https://mstem.net/projects/ta/index.php).

This is not present website of this company as it was replaced by newer version made by some other entity.

## Hire me
I am open for work as an **intern in some IT company in Krak√≥w, Poland** where I could learn programming in Python and other 
langauges or other concepts of IT field. If you would like to propose me some **internship** or a 
**trainee job position** related to IT you can contact me through my blog [mstem.net](www.mstem.net) or social media. 
All links are included at my blog.

## Demo
I will try to make live demo accessible to play through Chrome Browser posted at my blog but 
first I have to construct that game. So first things first.

Link to this Github repository will be available at my blog [mstem.net](www.mstem.net) so you will be able to 
download code for this game and play in on your computer.

## Credentials
I would like to thank here Christian Thompson, creator of [@TokyoEdTech](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2vm-0XX5RkWCXWwtBZGOXg) 
YouTube Channel. I learned a lot of Game Development in Python from this channel.

## Licensing
I make this game for free to download, distribute, modify or play. I think the name of
the licence would be General Public Licence (GPL).
