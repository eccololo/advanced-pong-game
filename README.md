# Advanced Pong Game
This is a simple pong game made in **Python** and **Turtle Library** with some cool
features that I could call more advanced. This project is the result of about a year
of learning Python and later **Game Development** in Python using Turtle library.

It is my own project and I am building it **from scratch**. I hope you will find this code 
useful and I hope it will teach you something about Python or Game Dev in this language.
